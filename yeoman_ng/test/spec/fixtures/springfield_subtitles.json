I mean, if you two guys are bored, get a dog!  We're not bored, dad!

We've adopted a baby. </span><br><span> Her name is Lilly  Exciting!  Just turn it off. </span><br><span> - I can't turn it off, it's who I am!  The music! - Oh, yes, the music. </span><br><span> Come, say hello Lilly. </span><br><span> Lilly? Isn't that gonna be hard for her to say? - Phil. </span><br><span> Excuse me Okay, I know that I said I thought this was a bad idea. </span><br><span> But  What do I know?  I mean, It's not like I wrote a book on fatherhood. </span><br><span> I'm trying whole my life to get it right, i'm still screwing up. </span><br><span> Right, Manny?  I wrote a song about it in the car. </span><br><span> - Ofcourse you did. </span><br><span> Anyway, I'm happy for ya! And you should know that  I'm not here to spit in your face, I'm here to blow at your back. </span><br><span> It's supposed to sound better in spanish. </span><br><span> Anyhow, Mitch. </span><br><span> No, dad, it's I got it, I got it. </span><br><span> She want's her daddy. </span><br><span> - Do you wanna meet grandpa?  You're kidding? She's one of us now, let me see that little potsticker!  Eey, you're a cutie, aren't you!  We're from different worlds. </span><br><span> Yet we somehow fit together. </span><br><span> Love is what's binds us. </span><br><span> Through fair, or stormy weather. </span><br><span> I stand before you now with only one agenda  To let you know my heart is yours. </span><br><span> Feldman, Brenda  I mean seriously!  Look, so far, he hasn't beaten me at basketball. </span><br><span> Get that! Will you step out of my kitchen!  Could you just do me a favour and just grab  How's the weather down there?  But, when the day comes that he does win, if, you know, if when  he beats me. </span><br><span> I'm just gonna be like, well done! Well done!  Just let him, just support him. </span><br><span> In that kind of stuff. </span><br><span> I'm probably just wanna go like, </span><br><span>  </span>"}
